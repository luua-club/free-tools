📖 PRD: Luua "Engineering as Marketing" Suite
Goal: Build 4 lightweight, client-side tools to drive traffic to the main product (Luua). Tech Stack: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons. Core Principle: "Zero Backend" (Logic runs in browser to save cost).

1. Global UI & Architecture
Shared Layout:

Header: Luua Logo (Left) | "Try Luua for Free" (Primary Button, Right).

The "Contextual Upsell" (Vital): A sticky or inline banner inside each tool.

Copy: "Don't want to fix this manually? Luua writes viral posts for you."

Footer: Links to all 4 tools (Internal linking mesh for SEO).

2. Tool Specs (The "Big 4")
Tool A: The Cross-Platform Post Previewer
User Story: "I want to see if my hook gets cut off on LinkedIn or X before I post."

UI Components:

Left: Text Area (Auto-expanding).

Right: Preview Card (Phone Mockup).

Toggle: [ LinkedIn Mobile ] [ LinkedIn Desktop ] [ X / Twitter ].

The "Heatmap" Logic (Killer Feature):

LinkedIn Mobile: Show a Red Line overlay at roughly 210 characters (or ~3 lines of text).

LinkedIn Desktop: Show a Red Line overlay at roughly 300 characters.

X: Show a "Circle Progress" counter. If > 280 chars, switch to "Long Post" mode (show 'Show More' text at ~280 chars).

Status Indicators:

Green Zone: "Safe (Hook visible)"

Red Zone: "Danger (Hook buried)"

Tool B: The "Viral Grade" Checker
User Story: "I want to know if my writing is too complex for social media."

Logic (Flesch-Kincaid):

Calculate "Reading Grade Level" (0-18).

Scoring UI (The Twist):

Grade 1-5: 🎉 "Viral Ready" (Green). Message: "Perfect. A 5th grader can read this."

Grade 6-8: 😐 "Okay" (Yellow). Message: "A bit complex. Try shorter sentences."

Grade 9+: ❌ "Academic/Boring" (Red). Message: "You sound like a textbook. Simplify it."

The Upsell: If Score is Red -> Button: "Fix with Luua AI" (Links to main app).

Tool C: "Code-to-Social" Converter
User Story: "I want to share code without it looking ugly or cropped."

Tech: prism.js (for syntax highlighting) + html2canvas (to download).

Controls:

Language Dropdown: (JS, Python, HTML, CSS).

Theme Toggle: (Dark/Light).

Format Toggle:

"LinkedIn Mode": Aspect Ratio 4:5 (Portrait). Padding: 40px.

"X Mode": Aspect Ratio 16:9 (Landscape). Padding: 60px.

Watermark: "Generated by Luua" (Small, bottom right - removable only if they sign up).

Tool D: The Smart Formatter
User Story: "I want to bold text and check whitespace density."

Features:

Bold/Italic: User highlights text -> Popover menu -> Replaces text with Unicode bold characters (e.g., 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱).

"X-Ray View" (Whitespace Check):

Button: "Check Density".

Action: Blurs the text (filter: blur(4px)).

Goal: Users can see "Blocks" of text. If a block is >4 lines thick, show "Wall of Text Warning."
